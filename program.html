		<main>
			<p>I have been into programming since a very early age using tools
			such as <span class = "tealtext">Visual Basic 2008/2018</span> as well as messing around with batch
			scripting on Microsoft Windows before I got my first introduction
			to <span class = "tealtext"> HTML </span> in freshman year at high school. Around sophomore year, I had
			learned my first "General Purpose" language <span class = "tealtext"> Python </span> and learned packages
			such as <span class = "tealtext"> PyGame </span> and <span class = "tealtext"> Selenium</span>, before moving 
			on to learn <span class = "tealtext"> C++. </span> During 
			my college enrollment; I received a professional refresh of <span class = "tealtext"> HTML </span> and 
			<span class = "tealtext"> CSS </span> skills leading to this page that you see now! Below are my projects that
			have been sorted by language.</p>
